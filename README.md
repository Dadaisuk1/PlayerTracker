# Git Workflow to Keep Code Updated on GitHub

Follow these steps to keep your code synchronized between your local repository and GitHub.

## Workflow Steps

1. **Stage All Changes**

   Add any changes you've made to the staging area:

   ```bash
   git add .

2. **Commit The Changes**

    Commit the staged changes with a descriptive message:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Describe the changes made"

3. **Pull the Latest Changes from GitHub**

    Before pushing, fetch any new updates from the remote repository to make sure your branch is up-to-date:
    ```bash
    git pull orgin main

    *Note: Replace main with master if that is the name of your default branch*

4. **Push Your Changes to GitHub**

    After ensuring your local branch is up-to-date, push your committed changes to GitHub:
    ```bash
    git push origin main
